General concepts
****************

Everything tangible (devices, variables) in this package is tied together via resources.

Devices
=======

A *device* typically refers to a physical piece of hardware, but can be, for example, a piece of software pretending to be hardware. 

Resources
=========

*Resources* provide a way of interacting with devices in a generic way. They can be read-only, write-only, or read-write.

Variables
=========

*Variables* are how sweeping acquisition experiments are described. A *variable* will have a range of values over which it iterates.
