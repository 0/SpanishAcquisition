The implementation for the Tektronix DPO7104 oscilloscope is :class:`spacq.devices.tektronix.dpo7104.DPO7104`.

The following examples assume ``dpo = DPO7104(...)``.

.. _device_specific_dpo7104_fastframe:

"FastFrame" mode
****************

In order to allow fast triggering for on-board averaging, the device can be placed into "FastFrame" mode (``dpo.fastframe = True``), which enables memory segmentation. The acquisition memory is split up into the requested number of frames (``dpo.fastframe_count = 17``); this has the negative side effect of decreasing the maximum allowed resolution, since all frames share the same acquisition memory.

The final frame must be enabled in either average (``dpo.fastframe_sum = 'average'``) or envelope (``dpo.fastframe_sum = 'envelope'``) mode.

.. note::
   ``dpo.fastframe_count`` includes the final frame.

Waveform acquisition
********************

The property :attr:`spacq.devices.tektronix.dpo7104.Channel.waveform` downloads a single frame from the device. If "FastFrame" mode is enabled (regardless of the final frame setting), only the last frame is downloaded.

Extremely large waveforms are downloaded in chunks (the size of which is specified by ``dpo.max_receive_samples``) and are assembled into a single waveform locally.
